title: Breadcrumbs
description: Breadcrumbs offer a contextual cue to where the user is in the site hierarchy. They are especially useful when users arrive at a page from a different website (e.g, Google) and provide a sense of context to where they are and allows them to quickly navigate to a different context if necessary.
